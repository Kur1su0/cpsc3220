Sample Exam Questions

1. Briefly define:

   metadata
   open file table

Directory entry / Inode / Per-Open Data Structure / Process Control Block.
Circle one of D, I, PODS, or PCB, as applies.
2. D / I / PODS / PCB  Contains filename.
3. D / I / PODS / PCB  Contains timestamps for file.
4. D / I / PODS / PCB  Contains a list of open files descriptors.
5. D / I / PODS / PCB  Contains pointer to current byte or record in file.

True/False. Circle either T or F.
6. T / F  A fully-qualified path name on Unix doesn't need a device id.
7. T / F  Unix protects files based on an access control list that is
          summarized into three categories of users: owner, group, world.
8. T / F  Logical record size is determined by the size of the disk sectors.
9. T / F  A physical record is transferred in one device I/O operation.

10. Explain the differences between an access control list and a capability
    list.
