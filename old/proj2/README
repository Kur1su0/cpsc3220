Description:     thread with uncontext

KNOWN PROBLEMS:  1. Auto grader shows threadExit cannot get correct return val but my test case works fine.
                 2. Cannot fully free thread because this program is designed using array pointer.
                 3. not understanding what thread lock unlock, wait and signal really does 
                    and array pointer is rough to implement these API.
                 4. preemetive test fails when calling printf function (not user section). Cannot be resolved.

DESIGN:          Using array pointer. It easy to come up with but harder to implement the lock related API.
